# financial-news-analysis
## Overview
This project is focused on setting up the development environment, establishing version control with Git and GitHub, and conducting an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the financial news dataset. This task serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis and model development.
# Getting Started
## 1. Repository and Branch Setup
1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**

Create a new repository on GitHub named `financial-news-analysis`.

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/olaniSiyum/financial-news-analysis.git
```
2. **Create a New Branch**
Create and switch to a new branch named `task-1`
```bash
git checkout -b task-1
```
3. **Set Up Version Control:**
Ensure `.gitignore` is properly configured to exclude unnecessary files (virtual environment files, data).
```bash
echo "venv/" >> .gitignore
```
## 2. Development Environment Setup
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
Create a `requirements.txt` file listing necessary packages(like pandas
matplotlib seaborn nltk pytest numpy)
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
## 3. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
`Publisher Activity:` Count the number of articles per publisher.
